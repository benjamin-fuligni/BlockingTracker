    <string name="about_text">
        "Throughout the course of a rehearsal process, Stage Managers need to record the "
        "blocking/choreography of scenes as the directors and actors stage them. This process "
        "is highly tedious on paper and often is slower than the pace of rehearsal. Furthermore, "
        "the staging will often go through many revisions, which can clutter a paper record with "
        "several edits.\n\n"

        "Blocking Tracker makes the beleaguered Stage Manager’s life easier. "
        "Instead of countless pages of half-erased pencil marks and scratched-out directions, "
        "we provide a simple image template onto which actor blocking can be recorded simply "
        "and efficiently, using modular icons that can be changed with ease.\n\n"

        "INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
        "In the Script View, highlight a portion of text to record the actors' positions at "
        "that moment. This will take you to the Set View, where you can hit the \"+\" button to add "
        "an actor label and a dot representing their location. Tap once on a dot to select it, "
        "then either elsewhere on the set to move it, or on the trash can icon to delete it. "
        "Once you are done with a segment, hit the save icon to save it and return to the Script "
        "View. To return to a blocking point, simply highlight just the footnote in the Script "
        "View at the point you want to return to.\n\n"

        "Blocking Tracker is the creation of Ben Fuligni and Selena Groh for Tufts University’s "
        "Mobile Development course (Fall 2017) taught by Ming Chow. "
        "Much gratitude and acknowledgement to Ming Chow and our fellow students.\n\n"
