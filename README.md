# Blocking Tracker
Ben Fuligni and Selena Groh | COMP150: Mobile Development | Fall 2017

Throughout the course of a rehearsal process, Stage Managers need to record the blocking/choreography of scenes as the directors and actors stage them. This process is highly tedious on paper and often is slower than the pace of rehearsal. Furthermore, the staging will often go through many revisions, which can clutter a paper record with several edits.

This Android app intends to solve this problem by digitizing this process. Instead of countless pages of half-erased pencil marks and scratched-out directions, we will provide a simple image template onto which actor blocking can be recorded simply and efficiently, using modular icons that can be changed with ease.
